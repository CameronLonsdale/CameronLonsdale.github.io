# Bootstrapped Security for Startups and Small Business

Are you a small technology business or startup wanting security advice but are unsure where to begin? Where you need to focus will change in the first few years as you mature, acquire customers and your risk profile expands. Rather than start with a generic pentest, let me assess your current setup, and work together to map the shortest path to a more secure product.

What you receive:
- A threat model of your product, helping you focus on the important parts to protect.
- An in-depth code review and pentest looking for insecure practices and vulnerabilities.
- An optional Infrastructure, Build and IT Security review with best practice recommendations.
- Tailored defence in depth recommendations, addressing the biggest risks for your product.
- All of this reported however you'd like, a standalone document, Jira tickets or something else.

Your time is important, I would ask for:
- 1 hour call at the start to discuss focus areas and to conduct a threat model of your product.
- Asynchronous question & answers, batched at the beginning of a work day and completed in your time.
- 30 minutes closing call to review and wrap up

Reach me at <span style="color:#8cc2dd">consulting@cameronlonsdale.com</span> and let's work together.
