# Bootstrapped Security for Startups and Small Business

Are you a small technology business or startup who wants security advice but are unsure where to begin? Do you want to build good practices without hiring dedicated security staff? Rather than start with a generic pentest, let me assess your current setup, and help you create an improvement roadmap that makes sense for what your business is trying to achieve.

What you receive:
- A threat model of your product, helping you focus on the important parts to protect.
- A high level code review and pentest looking for insecure practices and vulnerabilities.
- An Infrastructure, Build and IT Security review with best practice recommendations.
- Recommendations on a future setup if you're looking to achieve compliance certificates and / or prevent security incidents
- All of this reported however you'd like, a standalone document, Jira tickets or something else.

Your time is important, I would ask for:
- 1 hour call at the start to discuss focus areas and to conduct a threat model of your product.
- Asynchronous question & answers, batched at the beginning of a work day and completed in your time.
- 30 minutes closing call to review and wrap up
