# Bootstrapped Startup and Small Business Security

Are you a small business or startup who wants security advice but are unsure where to begin? Do you want to build good practices before hiring dedicated security staff? Rather than start with a generic pentest, let me assess your current setup, and help you create an improvement roadmap that makes sense for what your business is trying to achieve.

What you receive:
- A threat model of your product, helping you focus on the important parts to protect.
- A high level code review and pentest looking for insecure practices and vulnerabilities.
- An Infrastructure, Build and IT Security review with best practice recommendations.
- Recommendation list 
- All of this reported however you'd like, a standalone document, Jira tickets or something else.

## Who am I?

I'm a security engineer with over 7 years of experience in Application / Product Security. I've seen how large enterprises like Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) operate, and witnessed smaller companies like Atlassian and Canva change security practices as they grew.
