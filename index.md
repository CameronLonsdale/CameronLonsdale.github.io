# Bootstrapped Security for Startups and Small Business

Are you a small technology business or startup who wants security advice but are unsure where to begin? Do you want to build good practices without hiring dedicated security staff? Rather than start with a generic pentest, let me assess your current setup, and help you create an improvement roadmap that makes sense for what your business is trying to achieve.

What you receive:
- A threat model of your product, helping you focus on the important parts to protect.
- A high level code review and pentest looking for insecure practices and vulnerabilities.
- An Infrastructure, Build and IT Security review with best practice recommendations.
- Recommendations on a future setup if you're looking to achieve compliance certificates and / or prevent security incidents
- All of this reported however you'd like, a standalone document, Jira tickets or something else.

Reach me at consulting@cameronlonsdale.com and let's work together.

## Who am I?

I'm a security engineer with over 7 years of experience in Application / Product Security. I've seen how large enterprises like Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) operate, and witnessed smaller companies like Atlassian and Canva mature their security practices as they grew.

## Help! I need some quick advice

Have you received an email from someome asking for a security bug bounty (money) in exchange for vulnerability details?
Or is there a newsworthy hack or vulnerability making the rounds which you need help understanding and figuring out what to do?

Reach out to quickhelp@cameronlonsdale.com and I'll do my best to get back to you.
